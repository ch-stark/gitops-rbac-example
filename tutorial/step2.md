OpenShift-Setup

1. Setup HTPasswd with some dummy-users (we create quite a lot of users for flexibility, adjust users and password for your purpose)
   by executing `sh createorupdatehtpasswd.sh`
2. Setup HTPasswd-Provider
3. review roles, rolebindings.yaml


execute Files.

Later the files could be converted into a ACM-Policy but monitoring, compliance purposes.
